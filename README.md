# Graph Visualizer
Graph theory is incredibly helpful in the development world, providing capabilities such as holding the connections within a list and searching through those connections seemingly in ways only limited to one's creativity, all while allowing the same capabilities of an Array list. I built this application to learn about the graph data structure, and I hope it's as visualizing of the graph as it was for me in building the project. It is additionally mobile friendly.
The running application can be found here: https://paulmeddaugh.github.io/Graph-Visualizer/

## Your Algorithm Cast
The following algorithms are supported by this application:

<b>Depth-First</b> - Searches from a point by exploring every connection it can find in one of its 'neighbors' before going on to another, and does this recursively, digging through one 'neighbor' branch before going on to the next.

<b>Breadth-First</b> - Explores all a point's 'neighbors', or connecting points, before searching all the neighbors of those neighbors.

<b>Minimum Spanning Tree</b> - <i>Uses weights with connections.</i> Determines the least 'weightiest' way to travel to every point.

<b>Shortest Path</b> - <i>Uses weights with connections.</i> Determines the least 'weightiest' path from one point to another.

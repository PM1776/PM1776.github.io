# Graph Visualizer
Graph theory is incredibly helpful in the development world, providing capabilities such as holding the connections within a list and searching through those connections in ways only limited to one's creativity, all while allowing the same capabilities of the list in an Array. I built this application to learn about the graph data structure, and I hope it's as visualizing of graph capabilities as it was for me in building it. It is additionally mobile friendly. </br></br>

## Supported Algorithm

### Graph Searching Algorithms
<b>Depth-First</b> - Searches from a point by exploring every connection found attached to one of its 'neighbors,' or points connected, before going on to another.

<b>Breadth-First</b> - Explores all of a starting point's neighbors, or points connected, before searching all the neighbors of those neighbors.

<i>Uses connection 'weights' (i.e. for storing miles)</i></br>
<b>Minimum Spanning Tree</b> - Determines the least 'weightiest' way to travel to every point in the graph.

<b>Shortest Path</b> - Determines the least 'weightiest' path from one point to another.

### Additional Algorithms
<b>Merge Sort</b> - Sorts the points in the graph by either their 'X' or 'Y' co-ordinate by spliting and sorting the list in sub-sections, and merging those subsections.

<b>Closest Pair of Points</b> - Finds the closest pair in the graph by determining the closest pair in smaller sections and merging those sub-sections (Divide and Conquer method).

## Maps
This application additionally has options to load a map of certain locations in the U.S. or a small binary tree.

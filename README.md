# Graph Visualizer
Graph theory is incredibly helpful in the development world, providing capabilities such as holding the connections within a list and searching through those connections seemingly in ways only limited to one's creativity, all while allowing the same capabilities of an Array list. I built this application to learn about the graph data structure, and I hope it's as visualizing of graphs as it was for me in building it. It also is additionally mobile friendly. </br>

## The Algorithm Cast
The following algorithms are supported in this application:

<b>Depth-First</b> - Searches from a point by exploring every connection it can find in one of its 'neighbors', or points connected, before going on to another, and does this recursively, digging through one 'neighbor' branch before going on to the next.

<b>Breadth-First</b> - Explores all a point's neighbors, or points connected, before searching all the neighbors of those neighbors.

<i>Uses 'weights' with connections (i.e. for storing miles)</i>
<b>Minimum Spanning Tree</b> - Determines the least 'weightiest' way to travel to every point in the graph.

<b>Shortest Path</b> - Determines the least 'weightiest' path from one point to another.
